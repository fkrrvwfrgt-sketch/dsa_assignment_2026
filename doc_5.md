# Documentation: Task 5 - Graph Traversal

## (a) Data Structure Definition
An **Adjacency Matrix** (a 2D integer array) is used to store edges between vertices.

## (b) Function Descriptions
- `BFS()`: Explores the graph using a queue to visit neighbors layer by layer.
- `DFS()`: Explores the graph by going as deep as possible into each branch via recursion.

## (c) main() Organization
The `main()` function takes the number of vertices and edges from the user, builds the adjacency matrix, and runs both BFS and DFS starting from vertex 0.

## (d) Sample Output
Enter number of vertices: 4
BFS Traversal: 0 1 2 3 
DFS Traversal: 0 1 2 3
