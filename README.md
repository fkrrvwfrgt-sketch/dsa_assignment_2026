# Data Structures and Algorithms - Assignment 2

This repository contains the implementation and documentation for 8 programming tasks as part of the DSA course.

## Project Structure
- **Programs:** Named as `prog_<q>.c` containing the C source code.
- **Documentation:** Named as `doc_<q>.md` containing logic, function descriptions, and sample outputs.

## Tasks Covered
1. Balanced Parentheses (Stack)
2. Infix to Postfix Conversion & Evaluation
3. Reverse Traversal of Linked List (Recursion)
4. Doubly Linked List (Insertion & Deletion)
5. Graph Traversal (BFS & DFS)
